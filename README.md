The employee attrition rate in our company is a crucial indicator of workforce stability and organizational health. It measures the percentage of employees who leave the company over a specified period, offering valuable insights into retention trends and potential areas for improvement. A higher attrition rate may signal underlying issues such as dissatisfaction with the work environment, lack of career growth opportunities, or ineffective employee engagement strategies. Conversely, a lower attrition rate suggests a more stable and satisfied workforce.
